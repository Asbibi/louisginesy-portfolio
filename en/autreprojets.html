						<h2>Illustration Posters for School Clubs</h2>
					</span>

					<p>
						During the 3 years I've spent at Telecom Sudparis, I joined several clubs and associations in which I often had a position related to communication.
						This way, I had the occasion to produce several illustrative posters for those clubs, mainly using the software Gimp.

					<p class="autre-proj-p">
						The GATE project is a group project mandatory for first year students of Telecom Sudparis. The subjects are various and not necessarly related to a technical topic.
						I decided to join the Fresqu'It project.
						<br><br>
						We were 7 students aiming to produce a mural painting in a tunnel at Evry.
						An peculiarity of that project being that we didn't want to paint this fresco alone, but with the participation of children and teenagers living in Evry.
						<br>
						During this project, another student and me were in charge of the external communication, and here is the recap video that we've realized and the end of the project.
